Intrusive containers  
 Advantages:
    -  doesn't invoke any memory management at all
    -  iteration is faster. 
    - Intrusive containers offer predictability when inserting and erasing objects 
    since no memory managed is done with intrusive containers
 Disadvantages:   
    -Thread-safety analysis is harder
    -In intrusive containers you don't store a copy of an object, 
    but they rather the original object is linked with other objects in the container.
    - The user has to manage the lifetime of inserted objects independently from the containers.
