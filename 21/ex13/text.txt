Dear President,Dear Vice-President,Dear Commissioner,Furtherto the letter of December 2020, endorsed by more than 5,000 judges andprosecu-tors of the Member States, 
we, the representatives of Polish civil society organisations and European scholars specialisingin EU law and human rights, are writing to you once again in connection with the worsening 
rule of law crisis in Poland. We have now reached a stage where independent judges seeking to apply EU law and the Court of Justice’s judgments are threatened with abusive criminal charges 
and coercive measures. We urge you therefore to urgently adopt concrete legal measures to prevent the further destruction of the rule of law in Poland.In particular, we would like to ask you 
to immediately refer Poland to the Court of Justice regarding the “Muzzle Law” and the functioning of the Disciplinary Chamber,1and to simultaneously submit a comprehensive application for 
interim measures –with the aim of having them granted as soon as possible. The content of such a request and its grounds are set out later inthis letter.The deadline set by the Commission in 
its additional reasoned opinion addressed to the Polish's government regarding the “Muzzle Law” and the suspended Disciplinary Chamber passed at the end of February 2021. Even so, the Polish 
authorities have not stopped sys-tematically breaching EU law and ignoring the Court of Justice’s rulings At the same time, Polish authorities have significantly and deliberately increased 
their activ-ities intended to produce irreversible legal effects and to organise a permanent breach of EUrequirements of judicial independence before the pending action in Case C-791/19 and
the Commission’s expected action in the mentionedcaseare decided by the Court of Justice.Notwithstanding Poland’s requirement to suspend the operation of the Disciplinary 
Chamberin disciplinary cases regarding judges,2this body –which is not a “court” within the meaning of EU and Polish law –is still unlawfully suspending Polish judges in their official 
duties and authorising the prosecution of national judges on criminal charges.3Apart from the well-known decisions of the Disciplinary Chamberto suspend Judges Paweł Juszczyszyn, 
Beata Morawiec and Igor Tuleya, this body's planning further actions in the immediate future. On 21 April 2021, the Disciplinary Chamber is planning to decide on the detention and the use of 
coercive measures against Judge Igor Tuleya in order to press criminal charges against him for the content of his ruling. On the following day, this body will be dealing with the matter 
of lifting the immunity of Judge Józef Iwulski, who is the President of the Labour and Social Security Chamber of the Supreme Court, with the aim of preventing the Court of Jus-tice to decide
on requests for preliminary ruling referred by this chamber.Simultaneously, the Public Prosecutor’s Office, under the total controlof the Minister of Jus-tice, has requested the Disciplinary 
Chamber to authorise criminal prosecution and to sus-pend a number of judges of the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court. These include Judge Włodzimierz Wróbel, who received overwhelming 
support in the recent elections of the First President of the Supreme Court, although the Polish President decided to appoint another person, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by the 
National Council of the Judiciary in its current unlawful membership.Other judges of the Criminal Chamber, including its President, Judge Michał Laskowski, as well as the former 
First President of the Supreme Court, Judge Małgorzata Gersdorf, are also targeted by the Public Prosecutor’s Office. As reported in the media,4 the prosecution au-thorities intend to press 
criminal charges against judges who decided to transfer disciplinary cases of advocates to the Criminal Chamber rather then allowing their examination by the suspended Disciplinary Chamber. 
It should be borne in mind that, having suspended the functioning of this body, the Court of Justice also requiredPoland to refrain from referring all cases to the Disciplinary Chamber before
a panel whose membership does not satisfy the requirementsof independence.5These requirements are manifestly not met by any for-mations of this body.Simultaneously, the Polish parliament is
considering further amendments to the Lawon the Supreme Court, which are important from the point of view of its independence.6A number of its provisions are to come into force within 14 
days of the publication of this law in the official journal, including those which allow the Polish President to arbitrarily appoint in-terim presidents of the Supreme Court’s chambers, 
 without the need to hold an election procedure in each chamber. This measure is similar to the new provisions on the election of the First President of the Supreme Court of 2020, which the
Commission rightly raised in Poland’s chapter of its Rule of Law Report of September 2020.7The legislative process for this law is expected to be completed in the coming days, which means
that this act will be waiting for the President’s signature and publication in the official journal.Additionally, the members of the Disciplinary Chamber, as wellas the current unlawfully 
appointedFirst President of the Supreme Court,8have consistently demanded that the said President of the Labour and Social Security Chamber transfer the files of the cases in which that 
chamber requested the Court of Justice to give preliminary rulings on the status of in-dividuals appointed to the Supreme Court in gross breach of the law following the nominationprocedure 
be the National Council of the Judiciary in its current membership.9We would like to reiterate that the current First President of the Supreme Court is also in this group.Furthermore, on 
28 April 2021, the Constitutional Tribunal–which is a body that lacks in-dependence according to the Commission’s own assessment–is to consider a question of lawreferred to it by the
Disciplinary Chamber the day after it was suspended by the Court of  Justice.  The  unlawfully  composed  Constitutional  Tribunal  will  pretend  to  have  the urisdiction to examine
the constitutionality of Article 4(3) TEU and Article 279 TFEU, insofar as they require a Member State to comply with interim measures concerning the system and the functioning of the national 
judiciary10.These circumstances relate directly to the Commission’s recent infringement procedure mentioned above. The continued functioning of the Disciplinary Chamberand the unlaw-ful 
appointment of its members,and other individuals appointed to the Supreme Court atthe request of the National Council of the Judiciary in its current unlawful membership, severely threatens the 
independence of Polish courts and will produce irreversible legal effects resultingin a permanent breach of EU law and the requirements of the rule of law.The expected decision of the 
Disciplinary Chamber to allow for detention against Judge Igor Tuleya may mark the first time in the European Unionwhen force is used against a national judge for the content of his ruling. 
The intention to press criminal charges against judges, with the complicity of a body which patently does not constitute a “court”, would exacerbate the “chilling effect” experienced by the 
members of Poland’s judiciary and seriously under-mine the effective and uniform application of EU law by the Polish courts. Faced with the prospect of arbitrary criminal or disciplinary 
sanctions, judges will be reluctant to apply EU law, in particular the requirements related to effective judicial protection.Decisions of the Disciplinary Chamber to waive immunity and to 
suspend numerous judges of the Criminal Chamber and the Labour and Social Security Chamber of the Supreme Court, including their presidents, will have equally irreparable consequences 
and will mark the be-ginning of the end of mutual trust in respect of Poland. In this situation, the current unlaw-fully appointed First President of the Supreme Court will be able 
to decide, on her own, to transfer the files of pending cases to two new chambers. This will mean that several prelim-inary references to the Court of Justice of key importance to the 
entire EU legal order will be neutralised and no longer relevant. We are convinced that the main purpose of the ac-tions of the prosecutor’s office against these judges is indeed to prevent 
both the Court of Justice from dealing with those essential preliminary ruling questions and the Supreme Court from applying already decided preliminary ruling cases. This risk will be further 
in-creased by the outgoing amendmentsto the Law on the Supreme Court, which allow the Polish President to appoint interim presidentsofthe Supreme Court’schambers.The expected outcome of these 
developments will be to block any possibility of taking ad-vantage of any mechanisms provided in EU law to examine the status of individuals unlaw-fully appointed to the Supreme Court in gross 
breach of the Polish Constitution and EU law. This will seriously exacerbatePoland’s rule of law breakdown which has resulted, among
