Between 1952 and 1989 Poland was governed by a communist administration established after the Red Army's takeover of its territory from German occupation in World War II.
The state's official name was the "Republic of Poland" (Rzeczpospolita Polska) between 1947 and 1952 in accordance with the temporary Small Constitution of 1947.
The name "People's Republic" was introduced and defined by the Constitution of 1952.Like other Eastern Bloc countries (East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania),
Poland was regarded as a satellite state in the Soviet sphere of interest, but it was never a part of the Soviet Union.

The Polish People's Republic was a one-party state characterized by constant internal struggles for 
democracy. The Polish United Workers' Party became the dominant political faction,
officially making Poland a socialist country, but with more liberal policies than other states of the Eastern Bloc.
